# 🔁 Prompt Pattern: ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)

## 📖 What is ReAct?

ReAct prompting combines **reasoning** ("thinking step-by-step") with **acting** (taking intermediate actions like searching, calculating, or retrieving data). The model alternates between *thoughts* and *actions*, making it ideal for tool-augmented reasoning.

#### Note: Think of it like a detective who pauses to *think*, then *acts* (e.g., checks a clue), then thinks again — until they solve the case.

## 🧠 When to Use ReAct?

🔍 Tasks that need both reasoning and tool use (e.g., web search, calculator, APIs)

🪜 Problems where intermediate steps require actions outside the model's internal knowledge

🧠 Complex question answering that benefits from external lookups

🤖 Agent-like workflows where the model "thinks, acts, and learns"
