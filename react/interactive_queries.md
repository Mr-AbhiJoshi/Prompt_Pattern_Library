# üîÅ Prompt Pattern: ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)

## üß™ Use Case: Interactive Question Answering with Tools or Simulated Actions

## Case 1 (Movie selection from a database)

### üìù Prompt Used

You are an assistant who selects the best movie using ReAct prompting.
You must think aloud, then simulate actions such as Search[], Filter[], and FinalAnswer[].

Task: Find a science fiction movie from the 2010s with high ratings and strong female leads.

### ü§ñ Model Output

Thought: I need to find science fiction movies from the 2010s, then filter for high ratings and strong female leads.

Action: Search[science fiction movies from 2010 to 2019]

Observation: Found a list including Arrival (2016), Interstellar (2014), Ex Machina (2015), The Martian (2015)

Thought: Now I‚Äôll filter for high ratings (e.g., IMDb > 7.5)

Action: Filter[movies with IMDb > 7.5]

Observation: All listed movies meet the criteria.

Thought: Now check for strong female leads.

Action: Filter[movies with central female characters]

Observation:

Arrival stars Amy Adams as a linguist who deciphers alien language

Ex Machina features Alicia Vikander as an AI

Interstellar includes Anne Hathaway, but she is not the central lead

The Martian stars Matt Damon

Thought: Arrival and Ex Machina are the best fits.

Action: FinalAnswer[Arrival (2016)]

‚úÖ Final Answer: Arrival (2016)

## Case 2 (Troubleshooting a printer issue)

### üìù Prompt Used

You are a support assistant that uses ReAct prompting to diagnose and resolve issues.

Task: A user says their wireless printer is not printing, even though it‚Äôs connected to Wi-Fi.

### ü§ñ Model Output

Thought: I should check if the printer is recognized by the computer.

Action: AskUser[Can your computer detect the printer in the device list?]

Observation: Yes, it shows up as "HP Envy 4520" in the device list.

Thought: Next, check the print queue or if any errors show.

Action: AskUser[Are there any documents stuck in the print queue or error messages?]

Observation: Yes, there's a job stuck with an error "offline printer."

Thought: The printer might be in sleep mode or needs to be reset.

Action: Suggest[Power cycle the printer and try printing again.]

Observation: User restarted the printer and the print job succeeded.

Action: FinalAnswer[Issue resolved by power cycling. Printer was stuck in sleep/offline mode.]

‚úÖ Final Answer: Printer was offline. Restarting it resolved the issue.

## Case 3 (Solving a text-based puzzle)

### üìù Prompt Used

You are a reasoning detective assistant. Use ReAct prompting to solve the mystery step by step.

Task: Solve the mystery from the clues.

Clues:
1. The painting was stolen at night.
2. Only two people had access: the butler and the maid.
3. The maid says she was preparing breakfast at the time.
4. The butler says he was fixing a fuse due to a power cut at 10 PM.
5. The CCTV confirms the power cut occurred at 10 PM.

### ü§ñ Model Output

Thought: Let's cross-reference the statements with the clue about time.

Action: Verify[When was the painting stolen?]

Observation: It was stolen at 10 PM during the power outage.

Thought: The maid claims she was making breakfast ‚Äî that doesn‚Äôt add up.

Action: Analyze[Does preparing breakfast at 10 PM make sense?]

Thought: The maid's alibi is suspicious.

Action: FinalAnswer[The maid is lying and is the likely thief.]

‚úÖ Final Answer: The maid is the thief. Her alibi contradicts the timeline.

### üß† Observations

ReAct encourages deliberate, modular thinking: the model reasons, acts, observes, and loops.

It excels at problems involving external information gathering, stateful interactions, or multi-step decision-making.

The structure mimics how real-world agents behave.

## üí° Reflections

ReAct prompting is ideal for interactive tasks that require both thinking and doing.

It offers transparency at each step: how the model reasons, what actions it takes, and what it learns from them.

Useful in areas like customer support, research assistants, and puzzle solving ‚Äî anywhere that involves incremental deduction or tool use.

Combining ReAct with retrieval tools, calculators, or simulated APIs unlocks even more practical use cases.
