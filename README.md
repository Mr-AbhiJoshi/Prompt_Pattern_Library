# 🧠 Prompt Pattern Library

Welcome to my **Prompt Pattern Library**, a curated collection of prompt engineering experiments focused on mastering various advanced prompting strategies using Large Language Models like ChatGPT.

This repository is part of my initiative to become **job-ready in Prompt Engineering**, a skill that is rapidly gaining demand in AI-integrated roles across industries. Each experiment is documented with real-world use cases, iterative prompts, and clear reasoning patterns.
