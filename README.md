# 🧠 Prompt Pattern Library

Welcome to my **Prompt Pattern Library**, a curated collection of prompt engineering experiments focused on mastering various advanced prompting strategies using Large Language Models like ChatGPT.

This repository is part of my initiative to become **job-ready in Prompt Engineering**, a skill that is rapidly gaining demand in AI-integrated roles across industries. Each experiment is documented with real-world use cases, iterative prompts, and clear reasoning patterns.

## 📌 Objectives

- 🤖 Master advanced prompting frameworks such as:
  - Chain of Thought (CoT)
  - ReAct
  - Few-Shot
  - Tree of Thoughts
  - Auto-CoT, etc.
- ⚙️ Apply prompt templates to solve real problems: logic, code, content, product design, etc.
- 📊 Document results, iterations, and learning in a professional way.
- 💼 Demonstrate prompt fluency and practical creativity.
