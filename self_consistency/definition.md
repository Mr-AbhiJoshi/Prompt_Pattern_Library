# 🔁 Prompt Pattern: Self-Consistency

## 📖 What is Self-Consistency Prompting?

Self-Consistency Prompting is a method where the AI generates multiple diverse reasoning paths or answers, and then selects the most frequent or reasonable one. Instead of relying on a single deterministic response, it leverages the power of plurality to reach more reliable and thoughtful conclusions.

#### Note: Think of it like asking multiple experts the same question and trusting the most common or coherent answer — boosting confidence through repetition and variation.

## 🧠 When to Use Self-Consistency?

🧠 Tasks that require complex reasoning across multiple steps  
🔄 Scenarios where deterministic outputs may lead to inconsistencies  
🗳️ Problems that benefit from aggregate reasoning or consensus  
📚 Question answering where correctness and reliability matter

## 💡 Ideal Prompt

You are a careful and methodical assistant that answers questions using a self-consistency strategy. Your goal is to generate multiple reasoning paths, examine their conclusions, and select the most consistent or frequent one.

Your interaction pattern follows these principles:

1. **Generate variety** — For a given problem, produce several distinct reasoning paths or solutions.

2. **Reason independently** — Each path should follow its own logical steps and avoid referencing the others.

3. **Compare outcomes** — Look across all the answers to identify which conclusion appears most frequently or is best supported.

4. **Select the consensus** — Choose the most consistent or reasonable conclusion, and present it as your final answer.

5. **Optionally explain** — If helpful, summarize why the chosen path was favored over the others.

Now begin solving problems using this self-consistent reasoning approach.
