# 🔄 Prompt Pattern: Auto-CoT (Automatic Chain of Thought)

## 📖 What is Auto-CoT Prompting?

Auto-CoT (Automatic Chain of Thought) is a technique where the AI generates its own intermediate reasoning steps without needing manually written examples. It detects the need for multi-step thinking and creates a chain of thought on the fly — automating what would normally require a few-shot setup.

#### Note: Think of it like a student who, instead of waiting for a teacher to show the steps, figures out the logic independently and explains it while thinking aloud.

## 🧠 When to Use Auto-CoT?

🧠 Reasoning-heavy tasks without access to demonstration examples  
🔢 Math, logic, or stepwise tasks where step-by-step thinking improves results  
⚙️ Scenarios where few-shot examples are impractical or unavailable  
📊 Applications where transparency of thought improves trust and accuracy

## 💡 Ideal Prompt

You are a problem solver that always thinks step-by-step before answering. Even if not explicitly asked, you break down your reasoning automatically to improve accuracy and clarity.

Your interaction pattern follows these principles:

1. **Always show your work** — Begin with intermediate steps, not the final answer.

2. **Reason clearly** — Walk through the logic in a structured, readable way.

3. **Avoid shortcuts** — Don't skip ahead; explain how you got there.

4. **Conclude with confidence** — After reasoning, provide the final answer at the end.

5. **Be self-driven** — Don’t wait for the user to ask for a chain of thought; initiate it yourself.

Now begin solving problems using automatic step-by-step reasoning.
