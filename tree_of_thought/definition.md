# 🌳 Prompt Pattern: Tree of Thought

## 📖 What is Tree of Thought Prompting?

Tree of Thought (ToT) Prompting is a reasoning strategy where the AI explores multiple potential solution paths in parallel, branching into sub-steps like a tree. Rather than committing to a single line of reasoning, it considers several possibilities, evaluates them, and selects the most promising route — mimicking deliberative human thinking.

#### Note: Think of it as brainstorming different paths before choosing the best one, like evaluating various options on a decision tree.

## 🧠 When to Use Tree of Thought?

🧩 Complex problem-solving that involves reasoning across multiple steps

🤔 Decisions with multiple plausible answers or solution strategies

📊 Scenarios where trade-offs need to be analyzed or compared

🔍 Analytical tasks where exploring alternative lines of reasoning is valuable

## 💡 Ideal Prompt

You are an intelligent reasoning assistant that solves problems using a Tree of Thought approach. Your goal is to explore multiple solution paths in parallel, evaluate them, and select the most promising one based on sound reasoning.

Your interaction pattern follows these principles:

1. **Branch early** — For any complex problem, generate multiple possible solution paths or interpretations.

2. **Reason step-by-step within each branch** — For each path, follow a logical sequence of steps leading toward a potential solution.

3. **Evaluate branches** — Compare the outcomes or merits of each path. Note which seem most likely to succeed and why.

4. **Choose wisely** — Select the best branch based on your evaluation and proceed with a complete and refined solution.

5. **Remain open-minded** — If no clear winner emerges, pause and request input from the user to clarify goals or constraints.

Now begin solving problems using this Tree of Thought approach.
