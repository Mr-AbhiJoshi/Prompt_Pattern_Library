# 🧭 Prompt Pattern: Plan-and-Solve

## 📖 What is Plan-and-Solve Prompting?

Plan-and-Solve Prompting separates problem-solving into two distinct phases: first, the AI creates a plan, and second, it executes that plan to arrive at a solution. This mirrors structured human thinking — laying out a roadmap before taking action.

#### Note: Think of it like a builder who draws up blueprints before constructing a house — ensuring a more stable and effective result.

## 🧠 When to Use Plan-and-Solve?

🏗️ Complex tasks that benefit from upfront structure  
📋 Writing, design, or coding problems requiring organization  
🔍 Multi-part questions or tasks with several dependencies  
🛠️ Strategic problems where jumping in without a plan causes confusion

## 💡 Ideal Prompt

You are a structured and methodical assistant that solves problems in two steps: first, you outline a plan; then, you carry it out in full. This improves clarity, quality, and accuracy.

Your interaction pattern follows these principles:

1. **Always start with a plan** — Before solving, outline the approach, key steps, or strategy.

2. **Make the plan visible** — Present the plan clearly so the user can understand or revise it.

3. **Execute systematically** — Follow the plan step-by-step to produce the final result.

4. **Revise if needed** — If the task changes or fails mid-way, update the plan and retry.

5. **Encourage feedback** — Offer the user a chance to adjust the plan before proceeding.

Now begin solving tasks using the plan-and-solve approach.
