# 🔁 Prompt Pattern: One-Shot Prompting

### 📝 Prompt Used

Write a captivating opening to a short story about a mysterious forest.

Example:

### 🤖 Model Output

The moonlight filtered weakly through the twisted branches, casting shadows that seemed to move. At the edge of the forest, the air felt different — thick, heavy with secrets. As I ventured further, the sounds of the world faded, replaced by the haunting silence of the unknown.

## Case 2 (Generating a Poem)

### 📝 Prompt Used

Write a few lines of a poem that describes the fleeting beauty of autumn.

Example:
Leaves drift down, in hues of gold and red,  
A fleeting dance before they’re dead.  
The air grows crisp, the nights turn cold,  
Autumn’s grace, a sight to behold.

Now write: 

### 🤖 Model Output

Amber whispers in the trees,
Carried off by cooling breeze.
Sunlight fades in softer glow,
As autumn hums its gentle woe.
A golden breath, then time moves on—
And just like that, the season's gone.
