# 🔁 Prompt Pattern: One-Shot Prompting

## 📖 What is One-Shot Prompting?

One-Shot Prompting shows the model *one* example of the task before giving it a new input. It strikes a balance between Zero-Shot and Few-Shot, providing just enough context to guide the model's behavior.

#### Note: Think of it like saying, “Here’s how to do it once — now try it yourself.”

## 🧠 When to Use One-Shot?

🧪 When a single example strongly illustrates the task

🧠 Medium-complexity tasks that confuse the model in Zero-Shot

📐 Structured output or formatting that benefits from a single demo

🧭 When data or space is limited (e.g., API token constraints)
