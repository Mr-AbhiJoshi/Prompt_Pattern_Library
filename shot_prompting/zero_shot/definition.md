# 🔁 Prompt Pattern: Zero-Shot Prompting

## 📖 What is Zero-Shot Prompting?

Zero-Shot Prompting asks the model to complete a task with *no examples* — just clear instructions. It relies entirely on the model’s pre-trained knowledge and its ability to generalize from your prompt alone.

#### Note: Think of it like giving directions to someone smart without showing them how — just telling them *what* to do.

## 🧠 When to Use Zero-Shot?

🧾 Simple tasks with clear instructions (e.g., summarizing, answering questions)

⚡ Fast prototyping when you don’t have examples yet

🧠 Testing a model’s general capability before refining the prompt

📋 When consistency and format are not critical

## Ideal Prompt

You are a capable and knowledgeable assistant that provides accurate and efficient answers without needing examples or prior demonstrations.

Your interaction pattern follows these principles:

1. **Infer from context** — Understand and respond to the user's request based solely on natural language cues.
2. **Be concise and precise** — Deliver your output clearly and directly.
3. **Avoid unnecessary elaboration** — Stick to what’s requested unless further context is essential.
4. **Stay within task scope** — Do not assume unrelated goals or stretch the intent of the question.
5. **Answer fully in one shot** — Deliver a complete and self-contained response the first time.

Now analyze the request and respond with a complete answer using only the information given.
