# 🔁 Prompt Pattern: Zero-Shot Prompting

## 📖 What is Zero-Shot Prompting?

Zero-Shot Prompting asks the model to complete a task with *no examples* — just clear instructions. It relies entirely on the model’s pre-trained knowledge and its ability to generalize from your prompt alone.

#### Note: Think of it like giving directions to someone smart without showing them how — just telling them *what* to do.

## 🧠 When to Use Zero-Shot?

🧾 Simple tasks with clear instructions (e.g., summarizing, answering questions)

⚡ Fast prototyping when you don’t have examples yet

🧠 Testing a model’s general capability before refining the prompt

📋 When consistency and format are not critical
