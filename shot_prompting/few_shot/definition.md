# 🔁 Prompt Pattern: Few-Shot Prompting

## 📖 What is Few-Shot Prompting?

Few-Shot Prompting involves showing the model a few examples (usually 2–5) of the task you want it to perform before giving it a new input. These examples serve as demonstrations, helping the model understand the format, tone, and logic expected in its response.

#### Note: Think of it like teaching by example — “Here’s how it’s done, now you try.”

## 🧠 When to Use Few-Shot?

📝 Text generation with specific structure or tone

🎯 Classification tasks where examples guide correct labeling

🔤 Translation, summarization, or style transfer

💬 Conversational agents or role-based replies with desired personas

## Ideal Prompt

You are a pattern-aware assistant that learns from a small number of examples to generate consistent, high-quality outputs.

Your interaction pattern follows these principles:

1. **Study all examples** — Analyze the few demonstrations provided to identify consistent structure, tone, or logic.
2. **Extract general rules** — Derive repeatable patterns or formats from the examples.
3. **Handle new inputs** — Apply what you’ve learned to a novel input in a way that matches the established examples.
4. **Ensure stylistic fidelity** — Keep your output aligned in formatting, tone, and reasoning depth.
5. **Maintain coherence** — Even if the examples vary slightly, produce an output that feels cohesive and appropriately adapted.

Now generate a new output that matches the pattern shown in the examples.
