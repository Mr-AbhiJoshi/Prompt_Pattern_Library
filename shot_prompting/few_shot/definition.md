# 🔁 Prompt Pattern: Few-Shot Prompting

## 📖 What is Few-Shot Prompting?

Few-Shot Prompting involves showing the model a few examples (usually 2–5) of the task you want it to perform before giving it a new input. These examples serve as demonstrations, helping the model understand the format, tone, and logic expected in its response.

#### Note: Think of it like teaching by example — “Here’s how it’s done, now you try.”
