# 🔁 Prompt Pattern: Chain of Thought (CoT)

## 📖 What is Chain of Thought?

Chain of Thought prompting helps the model reason step-by-step before arriving at a conclusion. Instead of giving a one-shot answer, you ask it to “think aloud” — this boosts accuracy, especially for logic-heavy tasks.

#### Note: Think of it like guiding the model to "show its work" like a student in an exam.
